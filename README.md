NFTrees x Open Campus ID – Edu-to-Earn on EduChain 🌍🌱
🚀 Project Overview
NFTrees is a gamified Edu-to-Earn platform that incentivizes students to complete climate education courses and earn Open Campus ID NFTs while allowing companies to sponsor education and carbon offset initiatives to receive ESG-compliant NFTrees.
Built on EduChain, this platform merges education, blockchain, and sustainability into a single ecosystem. Students gain certified NFT credentials, while companies enhance their sustainability impact and ESG compliance through blockchain-verified contributions.

🔗 How It Works
🎓 For Students

 2️⃣ Complete the Course – Students progress through an interactive, gamified learning experience.
 3️⃣ Earn Open Campus ID NFT – Upon successful completion, students mint a verifiable NFT credential.
 4️⃣ Mint an NFTree – Completing multiple courses allows students to mint NFTrees, symbolizing their contribution to sustainability.
 5️⃣ Track Impact & Leaderboard – Students see their CO₂ offset, badges, and progress on a leaderboard.
🏢 For Companies (ESG Sponsors)
1️⃣ Sponsor Climate Education – Companies contribute funds to support free access to climate courses.
 2️⃣ Earn ESG Carbon Offset NFTs – Their sponsorship is rewarded with NFTrees that act as blockchain-verified carbon offset certificates.
 3️⃣ Track Impact in Real-Time – A dedicated dashboard shows their total contributions, CO₂ offset metrics, and NFT ownership.
 4️⃣ Showcase ESG Credentials – Companies can use these NFTs for public ESG reporting and branding.
